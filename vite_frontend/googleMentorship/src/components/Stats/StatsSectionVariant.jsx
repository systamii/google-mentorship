        <h2>Racial Disparities in NYC Public School Teacher Workforce</h2>
        <p>
          According to data from 2020, the New York City public school teacher workforce skews White: 55% of teachers are White, 18% are Black, and 14% are Hispanic. This significant disparity is crucial because teachers' racial biases can influence their expectations for students, the quality of their teaching, and the decisions they make in managing their classrooms. Addressing this disparity is essential to ensure a fair and inclusive educational environment for all students.
